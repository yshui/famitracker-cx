# FamiTracker CX

**This is an old project that I worked on. It has since been discontinued.**
I'm putting it here for "historical" reasons.

Most of the core code is written by Jonathan Liss (jsr) and other contributors,
as taken from the original FamiTracker project at
[http://famitracker.com/](http://famitracker.com/). Almost everything in the
`famitracker-core` directory, with some changes by me, is written by him.
Everything else not in `famitracker-core` is written by Dan Spencer.

## What is FamiTracker CX?
FamiTracker CX is a free cross-platform fork of FamiTracker.

FamiTracker CX is created in order to bring the popular NES/Famicom music
tracker to Linux. More platforms such as Mac OS X are planned when circumstances
permit them.

The optional GUI is rewritten from scratch using the cross-platform Qt 4
library. An ncurses player is also available for terminal nerds.

ALSA and JACK are the two supported audio APIs. More are planned as the Windows
and OS X ports are completed.

The software license is mixed GPL v2/New BSD.
